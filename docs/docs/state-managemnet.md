## State Management Explanation

This project uses **React Query** for managing API data and state. Here are the reasons:

- **Simplified Data Fetching:**  
  React Query abstracts away the complexity of fetching, caching, and updating server state.

- **Caching & Background Refetching:**  
  It efficiently caches data and automatically refetches it in the background, ensuring a responsive UI.

- **Built-in Error Handling:**  
  React Query provides out-of-the-box states for loading and error, simplifying UI feedback.

This approach reduces boilerplate code and improves overall code quality and responsiveness.
